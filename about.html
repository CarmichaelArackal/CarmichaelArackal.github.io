                   <h5>I was Born in Baltimore, Maryland on May 9th, 2000
                    to two Indian American parents. I am the youngest
                    out of four kids. Not long after I was born, we moved
                    to Georgia and I've been here ever since. I went to 
                    Georgia State University for two years before finally
                    transfering to Georgia Tech, which is my dream school.</h5>
